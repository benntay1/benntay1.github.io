                            This project was done as part of my module
                            curriculum at NUS.

                        This project focusses on data science and business
                        analytics tchniques to extract actionable insights from
                        data. The dataset we used was a private dataset from an
                        online sales business, capturing data on item sales,
                        calorie nutrition values and collected details on
                        customers who bought the respective item.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our team's objectives were to increase the client's
                        revenue in a socially responsible and sustainable
                        manner, by introducing novel and personalised business
                        recommendations targetting both the management as well
                        as the consumers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our business recommendations were from a 2-pronged
                        approach: (1) association rule mining and (2) item
                        substitutions.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Association Rule Mining</h4>
                    <p>
                        Through ARM, we analysed the client's dataset and
                        generated rules with confidence > 0.60, these rules were
                        then targetted at customers of a higher income value. We
                        made this decision through monetary value analysis, in
                        which this group of customers contributed to over 40% of
                        the client's annual revenue for 2019.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Item Substitutions</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second part of our approach deals with targetting
                        customers who are of a BMI other than 'healthy'.
                        Overweight customers are then given item recommendations
                        based on their income levels as well, to ensure that
                        social welfare is taken into consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly for underweight customers.</p>
                    <h4>Evaluation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Through preliminary calculations and assumptions, we
                        estimate the client's annual revenue to increase by 14%.
