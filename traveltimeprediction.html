                        <p>
                            This project was done as part of the Microsoft Azure
                            Virtual Hackathon 2020, making use of Grab's GPS
                            dataset for travel time predictions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dataset: Grab-Posisi GPS Trajectory Dataset <br />
                            Techniques used: Geospatial Analysis, Machine
                            Learning, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio

                    <p>
                        This is a travel time prediction model for private-hire
                        cars in Singapore. The dataset used was from Grab, a
                        private-hire car company in Southeast Asia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dataset comes in the form of 1-second pings, with
                        information such as GPS coordinates, current speed
                        (estimated), type of device the driver is using,
                        bearing, date and time (in UTC format).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We originally made use of python and pandas to
                        manipulate the data to derive intuitive predictors for
                        determining the travel time of the ride. For example,
                        the predictors derived includes euclidean distance and
                        average bearing of the destination relative to the
                        source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also made HTTP requests to obtain weather and traffic
                        data from external APIs from LTA and OneMap. This
                        enabled us to get rainfall data by month and location
                        within Singapore, as well as regional information
                        (polygons) of the source and destination coordinates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We then made use of Microsoft Azure's Machine Learning
                        Studio to upload our dataset and code for model training
                        purposes. The eventual model made use of a stack
                        ensemble with RMSE of 224 seconds, as compared to 240 as
                        the benchmark for training RMSE.
